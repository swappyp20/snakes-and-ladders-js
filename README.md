Basic Just-Get-It-Working Game Flow
Game loads, get initialised with row, column and player name
Creates board, squares, snakes, ladders, players, die
Both players roll die, highest roller starts first
If a player lands on a snake, they go down, on a ladder, they go up, on the other player, the other player gets knocked off the board
First to reach the end (100) wins
	
Board Layout:
10x10 board
Ladders on 20(39), 48(67), 59(62), 69(88)
Snakes on 30(8), 44(25), 86(64), 99(83)
Think of a better way to handle the snakes and ladders:
- Send parameter to game (snakes, ladders)
- Game creates snakes and ladders at random, being intelligent about snakes and ladders

Colour Scheme:
Square A	: #4671D5
Square B	: #6C8CD5
InfoBar		: #1240AB
Text		: #06266F	
Background	: #2A4480
	
Also, maybe make separate .js files for objects, possibly allow use of jQuery/jCanvas inside them.
