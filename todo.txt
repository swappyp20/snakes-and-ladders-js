TO DO
- use jCanvas layers(?) or Kinetic.js(?) to write data to different parts of the screen
	- die
	- human name, score
	- computer name, score
	- current turn
- Run the game once completely in the console, just to make sure the game logic works (it should be tight, until the players reach 100)

DONE: 
- Figured out how to do fonts
- Done some basic CSSing
- The game loads the board in the background of the <div>
